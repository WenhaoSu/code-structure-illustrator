# Graphical Illustration of Code Structure
In this project, we have implemented an information visualization application using D3.js. This application have two functions: 1. visualize the structure of html with tree structure, 2. show the function relationship of java with hierarchical edge bundling. This project can help the developers to visualize the structure of html and easily understand how the java program works. In addition, in java visualization, one can click the specific parts to learn more. In this way, the application can help the users to quickly understand the program.
